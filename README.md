# 44clicker-py

Replacement for mechanical clickers for judging yoyo freestyles. Now in Python!

This is a fairly direct port of [the original](https://github.com/elephark/44clicker). It should look and act the same.

## Features
- Plus and minus clicks in ones and threes.
- Separate keys for each type of major deduct currently in use.
- All of the above, plus the appropriate totals, clearly displayed.
- Reset key, and also an "undo last reset" feature in case you hit it by accident.
- Timer, showing the elapsed and remaining time in the freestyle.

Built with PySide6 6.6.0 and Python 3.9.6.

Usage:
```
python3 mainwindow.py
```
